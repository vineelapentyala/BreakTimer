## About this project
We created a productivity application that simply does one thing - helps a user focus on a handful of tasks for a period of time (a session) using the Pomodoro technique[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique]. 

Every time block of typically 30 minutes has two components: productive time (25 minutes) to focus time (5 minutes) on a user-defined taks to work on. These time blocks are repeated throughout session. This helps a user feel less decision fatigue and keeps the mind sharp by focusing on one task at a time!

## Inspiration
Due to the recent times of COVID, we found ourselves bombarded by a ton of input coming from many electronic devices. It is very easy to get lost into the endless cycle of wasting time and not focusing on what matters. Soon, we came across the Pomodoro technique, which we believe will help users focus on tasks that matter in an intentional way. This is a true productivity application that we wanted to create to help us be more efficient and intentional! Besides, we tried to incorporate various refreshing activities during the break-time.

## How we built it
We used python to build this project. For the back-end we created several objects that will help run the project. TODO: Add front-end items here
